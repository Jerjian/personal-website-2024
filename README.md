# Overview
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a Full Stack Developer. The site features a responsive and interactive design, highlighting my projects, skills, and background. It is built using modern web technologies, focusing on both functionality and aesthetics.

# Key Features
Dynamic Theming: The website supports dark and light modes, which are toggled based on user preferences. This is achieved through CSS variables and Material-UI theming.

Interactive Animations: Elements like profile pictures, buttons, and cards come to life with smooth animations that enhance user experience without compromising performance.

Project Showcase: A carousel-based gallery of my work, complete with descriptions, technologies used, and links to GitHub repositories and deployed applications.

Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Frontend:
React.js: For building the UI components.
